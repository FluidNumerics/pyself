# Python interface for SELF

The [Spectral Element Library in Fortran (SELF)](https://github.com/fluidnumerics/SELF) is a Fortran library that provides Fortran classes for creating PDE solvers using Spectral Element Methods. SELF natively provides support for running on everything from local workstations to large supercomputers. It provides automatic GPU and multi-GPU acceleration when available.

[PySELF](https://pypi.org/project/pyself/) provides a python interface for SELF. This gives you the ability to flexibly construct complete simulation workflows, without having to work in Fortran.
